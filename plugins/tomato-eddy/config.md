# ðŸ’¿ Config

### GitHub Integration

to integrate and connect GitHub to your server you need to add this config to your `services.php` config

```php
'github' => [
    'client_id' => env('GITHUB_CLIENT_ID'),
    'client_secret' => env('GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET'),
    'redirect' => 'https://example.com/admin/github/callback',
],
```

where `https://example.com` is your domain name and on your .env file change `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`   `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` with your own.

now you need to create a  new app on  your GitHub, The simplest way to create a GitHub app is to go to GitHub itself:

* Go to the `Settings` page of our profile.
* Go to `Developer Setting` from the left menu.
* Click on the `New GitHub App` button.

now your GitHub is connected and you can try to add new Credentials to GitHub.
