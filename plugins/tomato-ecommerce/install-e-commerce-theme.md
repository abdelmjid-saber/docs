# ðŸŽ­ Install E-commerce Theme

we have a ready E-Commerce theme you can install it by just using a composer like this

```bash
composer require tomatophp/ecommerce-theme-module
```

or for the module system

```bash
composer require tomatophp/one-theme-module
```

now go to your dashboard `/themes` and you will get the new theme you can activate it.

please note that you must not have `/` route on your main `routes/web.php` because these routes can override the Theme Routes
