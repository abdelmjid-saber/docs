# 🖍 Use

this builder can be used as a main generator for CRUDs like [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") but with GUI and Schema Builder, so you don't need to build your schema inside your Laravel app just build a GUI schema and build it to an app.

the builder doesn't build a Web base it's building a flutter app so you can generate a full code blueprint with just 1 click.
