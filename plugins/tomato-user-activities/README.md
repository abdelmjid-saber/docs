Advanced logger is a Laravel package used to automatically log every request made to your Laravel application. Each request is also identified by a hash, which can be used in the standard log to identify the request.

This package has been inspired by the package [https://github.com/andersao/laravel-request-logger](https://github.com/andersao/laravel-request-logger) from Anderson Andrade.
