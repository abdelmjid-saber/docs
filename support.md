## Sponsoring

TomatoPHP is meant to be free, forever. Having a good companion for developing real-time applications locally and in production should not involve any third party and having a reliable app easy to deploy on a server makes TomatoPHP a compelling option for many applications.

Of course, like many open-source software solutions, development is done by investing volunteer time into the project. Therefore, all donations are greatly appreciated. You can sponsor the development via [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/3x1io).
